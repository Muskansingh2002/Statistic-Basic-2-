    "Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: Outliers can greatly influence the mean because it takes into account every value in the dataset. A single outlier with a very large or very small value can pull the mean in its direction, making it unrepresentative of the majority of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The median is less affected by outliers because it is not influenced by extreme values. It represents the middle value of the dataset when it is ordered from smallest to largest. Therefore, even if there are outliers present, the median remains relatively stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode: The mode, representing the most frequent value in the dataset, may be unaffected by outliers if they do not occur frequently. However, if an outlier occurs with a high frequency, it may influence the mode by shifting the peak of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Dispersion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: Outliers can significantly affect the range because it is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. If there are extreme values present, the range will be larger, reflecting greater variability in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance and Standard Deviation: Outliers can inflate the variance and standard deviation because they measure the average deviation of each data point from the mean. Outliers, being far from the mean, contribute to larger squared deviations, thus increasing the overall dispersion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a dataset representing the salaries of employees in a company:\n",
    "\n",
    "[30,000,35,000,40,000,45,000,50,000,1,000,000]\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The mean salary is significantly influenced by the outlier (1,000,000), resulting in a much higher mean than what is representative of the majority of the employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The median salary, which is the middle value (45,000), is less affected by the outlier and remains a more accurate representation of the typical salary in the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: The range, influenced by the outlier, becomes much larger, reflecting the presence of extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance and Standard Deviation: The variance and standard deviation are inflated by the presence of the outlier, indicating greater variability in the salaries.\n",
